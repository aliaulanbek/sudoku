# sudoku

Sudoku is a puzzle game that challenges players to fill each of the squares in a 9x9 grid with the digits between 1 and 9. The rules state that the same digit cannot appear twice in any row or column. In addition, the board is divided into 3x3 regions, each of which must not include the same digit twice.

This program generates random positions and determines if it is legal to places a random number there. It repeats the filling in process until the board is almost full ( ~93% ).
